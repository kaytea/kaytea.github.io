            Built using C# and Unity; Using the Kinect, Kinected Graphs allows the user to traverse a database of many-to-many relations in a 3D environment, navigating nodes by hand. Each entry in the database is a node within a web of relations, that you can explore via gestures on the Microsoft Kinect. For any given node you can see a summary of its contents as well as all connected nodes which, when touched, will be snapped to center and have their information displayed. While demoed with Wikipedia, this application can be extended to any graph-like database, whether it be your Facebook network, exploring music genres, or even traversing your local file system. It’s a whole new way of interacting with your computer and your data! <a href="https://devpost.com/software/kinnected-graphs">Link to DevPost</a>
